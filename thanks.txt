A special mention to Vivek for his endless support, creative problem-solving, and the invaluable corporate lessons I’ve gained under your leadership. Kavitha, your impeccable work ethics have set a benchmark for us all.  

I’m also incredibly grateful to Priya, Vamsi, and Vikash for their unwavering support. This journey has been nothing short of amazing, and I genuinely hope our paths cross again in the future.
